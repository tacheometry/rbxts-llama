<h2>Installation</h2>

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/@rbxts/llama.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/@rbxts/llama)

Run `npm i @rbxts/llama` in your project directory.

<h2>Usage</h2>

After importing the library, you can use any utility from [the documentation](https://frelerik.github.io/llama/) in TS.

<h3>Llama data types for TS</h3>

-   Dictionaries are objects _`{}`_
-   Lists are arrays _`T[]`_
-   Sets are interpreted as JS Sets _`new Set<T>`_
    -- In roblox-ts, a `Set<number>` whose added values are `1` and `5` is just a table that looks like:
    `lua { [1] = true, [5] = true } `

<h3>Importing</h3>

```ts
import Llama from "@rbxts/llama";
```

or

```ts
import { Dictionary, List, Set } from "@rbxts/llama";
```
